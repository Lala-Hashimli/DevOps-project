**Reflection Questions**

Write a reflection (300-400 words) addressing:

1. Adaptation: How did your team adapt the Sprint Backlog when challenges arose?  What helped you make those decisions?
2. Collaboration: How did Daily Scrums improve team coordination? Were there  moments when transparency helped the team?
3. Sprint Goal: How did having a clear Sprint Goal help or hinder your  decision-making during the sprint?
4. Definition of Done: Did the Definition of Done help maintain quality? Were there  any tensions between speed and quality?
5. Continuous Improvement: What did you learn from the Sprint Retrospective?  How will the action items improve the next sprint?
6. Scrum Values: Provide an example of when your team demonstrated one of the  five Scrum values (Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, Courage).

> Throughout the sprint, the team had to shift gears a few times when unexpected impediments appeared on the team’s path. For Day 1, we found out the CI API documentation was not current. Instead of going back to zero, we chose to work on structure in the front-end and tests plan, while exploring the correct API endpoints. Later, a stakeholder asked for email notifications. We quickly debated whether such item was within our scope for the current sprint, and chose to defer to Product Backlog for a future sprint. It was helpful to define a clear Sprint Goal to make those decisions logical instead of emotional. Daily Scrums greatly increased our transparency. Each day, we all shared our activity and doubts. When the API issue appeared, the Fullstack Developer quickly explained it to the group, and the Scrum Master took a note to turn into an impediment. Such transparency allowed us to act quickly instead of wasting precious time in silent frustration. It was very clarifying for all.

> In this sprint, our team had to make a few adjustments when some unexpected problems came up. On Day 1, our team understood that the documentation of the CI API was not updated. However, instead of stopping all our development work, we decided to move ahead with our development work in the area of frontend structure and test planning.

> The Sprint Goal also helped us stay focused when small distractions appeared. Sometimes it is tempting to add extra improvements or accept new requests, but we reminded ourselves what we committed to at the beginning. That clarity made prioritization easier. The Definition of Done was also important. We did not mark tasks as completed unless testing and review were finished. When a small bug appeared in filtering, we discussed whether to move faster or fix it properly, and we chose quality.

> From the Retrospective, we realized we need better API validation at the start of the sprint and maybe a short backlog refinement session in the middle. These small improvements can help us avoid similar issues in the next sprint and work more confidently as a team.
