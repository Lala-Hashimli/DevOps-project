## Reflection

Write a short paragraph on how Scrum practices support DevOps principles.

> I see that Scrum supports DevOps by improving collaboration between team members and encouraging frequent delivery of working features. Short sprints and daily communication help us detect issues early and adapt quickly. This continuous feedback and improvement mindset aligns strongly with DevOps principles of automation, fast delivery, and shared responsibility.
